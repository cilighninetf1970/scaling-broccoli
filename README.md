This will initiate the download of the installer. Make sure to locate the downloaded file in your system's downloads folder.


## Step 2: Extract the Installation File


Once the download is complete, you may need to extract the installation file, especially if it comes in a compressed format. Right-click on the downloaded file and select "Extract All" from the context menu. Choose a destination folder where you'd like to keep the extracted files. Using tools like WinRAR or 7-Zip can make this process easier.


## Step 3: Run the Installer as Administrator


To ensure a smooth installation process, you need to run the installer with administrative rights. Navigate to the extracted folder and locate the *installer.exe* file. Right-click on it and select "Run as administrator". This will grant the necessary permissions for the installation.


## Step 4: Follow the Installation Prompts


Once the installer launches, follow the on-screen prompts:


1. Choose the appropriate installation directory.


2. Read and accept the license agreement to continue.


3. Select ‘Standard Installation’ for a typical setup, unless you have specific needs.


Be patient as the program installs. This may take a few minutes.
